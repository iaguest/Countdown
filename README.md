# Countdown

A just for fun implementation of the classic game. The UI is written using C# and WPF and makes use of a core game library written in C++17.

## Functionality of the application:
The app is a fully functioning single player version of Countdown. Each game has seven rounds consisting of four letters games, two numbers games and one conundrum game. A high score is maintained throughout. Possible solutions are suggested at the end of each round.
